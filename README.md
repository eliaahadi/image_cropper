# Image Cropper Mobile App
Crop images in React Native. Testing was done with Android, phone Xiaomi A1.

# Overview
- This project is to create a simple React Native image cropper that is:
  - modular
  - resize image (done with a zoom)
  - pan around an image
- Technology used is React Native with hooks.

# Setup
- Run these commands:
```
$ cd app
app $ yarn install
app $ yarn start
```
# Notes
- I was able to load an image and set a crop size and also make it a modular component. However, I didn't have enough time to make the crop feature fully functional due to time constraints. This is just a sample of work I could do.
